# WebPdfExport

## Client Note

Hey I'm trying to automate a stupid task I have to do every week.  Is there a tool that takes screenshots of a whole website and can send me all of them in a pdf?

## First Idea

- Using Selenium Webdriver with Python to take windowed screenshots and stich them together using PIL/Pillow, and some pdf package like pikepdf?

## Second Idea

- use a scraping package like beautifulsoup to construct a well formatted html document that can be converted to a well-formatted pdf document.
